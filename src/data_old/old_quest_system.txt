framework for a simple quest system in JavaTrek game engine
(nowd that blowing stuff up is possible, let's try to work with it instead)

a quest will consist of multiple stages, each having a requirement that must be
met in order to procede to the next stage

- travel to a destination (qx, qy, rx, ry)
- destroy specific ships (each ship should have a unique id number)
- destroy a number of unspecified ships from a specified team
- destroy a number of unspecified ships from any team
- visit a planet/base (each planet/base should have a unique id number)
- locate/meet a ship (each ship should have a unique id number)
- pick up item(s) (ships need to have the ability to carry cargo)
- drop off item(s) (ships need to have the ability to carry cargo)
- rewards (various rewards:  XP, upgrades, new ship, other)

classes:

- quest (each instance represents an outstanding quest)
	- an array of stages
	- a function for adding stages

- stage (each instance represents a requirement from the list above)
	- a requirement from the list above and data about it
	- a complete/outstanding setting
	
- questfactory
	- functions for generating quests and adding them to the game's quest object
