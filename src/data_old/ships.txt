As a new member, I have a few names for ships to send in, along with 
good ships to match the names... I know that a lot of, if not all, 
the ships in EVN have been named, so take these as you will.  If 
you're a plugin maker take them as you see fit.

MIRAGE - Cloaked ship or cloaking feild ship a la Arbiter.

COYOTE - Fast and manuverable fighter, perhaps a bit weak on the weapons side.

TIAMAT - An Oh My God Thats a ****ing Huge Battlecruiser perhaps?

ABHORSEN - A fast warship, one that looks sleek and organic.

CARAVEL - A trader with solar sails - warship variant could be called 
the GALLEIOT or GALLEON.

THOR - Any warship with a lightning beam!

BAB, EFFENDI, BAHA'U'LLAH - All named after influential members of 
the Baha'i faith, these are diplomacy vessels armed with ionizing 
weapons that only disable a ship.  DO NOT use as a warship name, the 
Baha'i are pacifist and THAT is why I thought they would be good 
diplomacy vessels.
